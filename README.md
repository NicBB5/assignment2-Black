###### Soccer
I like soccer because I played it for many years and I really like how big it is around the **world**,
because I feel like it brings us **together**. It is also very exciting and has very passionate fans. All the different teams from all different parts of the world are very enjoyable to watch. The World Cup coming around every 4 years is amazing. Lastly, the excitment of seeing a goal scored cannot be matched.

# Four Countries to Visit
These are countries that I recommend visiting based off my experienecs going to them. I have only been to a couple countries outside the US, but I feel like these four are some good suggestions. I also feel that each country brings their own style to the table meaning there should be a country for you no matter what you are into.

| Name of Country | Reason for Recommendation | Amount of days I would stay |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mexico | Beaches, warm, and food is great | 7 days |
| France | Wine, known for food, Art, and you can go to Paris | 5 days |
| Switzerland | Beatiful landscape, great people, and lots to do | 8 days |
| Japan | Citylife, video games, and countryside Japan | 10 days |
