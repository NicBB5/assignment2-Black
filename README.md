###### Soccer
I like soccer because I played it for many years and I really like how big it is around the **world**,
because I feel like it brings us **together**. It is also very exciting and has very passionate fans. All the different teams from all different parts of the world are very enjoyable to watch. The World Cup coming around every 4 years is amazing. Lastly, the excitment of seeing a goal scored cannot be matched.
