# Nicolas Black
My name is Nicolas Black I am 21 years old and I was born in Scottsdale, Arizona. I am really into music and have a collection of vinyl's and a record player to play them. I start collecting records about 5 years ago and my collection has grown a lot in size. My favorite record I probably have is "Songs in the Key of Life" by Stevie Wonder. My favorite record that I have been playing a lot is "Sublime" by Sublime.
